## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis using various machine learning algorithms on the provided dataset. The goal is to classify text into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) & K-Means Clustering
- Bayesian Learning
- Ensemble Learning: Bagging & Boosting

## Dataset
We used the [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset) from Kaggle. The dataset contains text data labeled with sentiment categories.
